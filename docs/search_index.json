With the knowledge that there are few missing data from the Year 2010 to Year 2019 , we take a look at the precentage of the data that are missing in the graph. Looking into the literature of the Juvenile Arrests Data , we see that he FBI no longer reports arrests for running away since 2010 , this is why we see missing values in the graph. In similar terms, in 2013, the FBI broadened the definition of rape, removing the phrase “forcible” from the offense name and description , this led to difference in reporting practices of the different reporting agencies,this means that we do not have accurate data for the offense after 2012. 4.2 Missing Data in Gun Violence Archive The Stacked bar Plot for the Gun Violence Dataset shows that there are no missing data , this goes to show that Gun violence is being tracked meticously and all the information is duly available. As there is no missing data in the gun violence archive data , there is no inference of reason that can be drawn from it. 4.3 Missing Data in Hate Crime Data In the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program , we have multiple datasets where in each dataset shows the HateCrime data against one facet. 4.3.1 Hate Crime data by Offense Due to the change of definition of by FBI as described above , we see the same missing data pattern in the Uniform Crime Reporting data. 4.3.2 HC by Place "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
