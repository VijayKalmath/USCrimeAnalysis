<h1 align = "center"> US Crime Data Analysis </h1>

In this project, we aim to analyze data related to crime in the United States while focusing on various aspects such as age,sex,race of offenders and victims, correlation between crime rate rise/fall and parallel political/social events and a deep dive into the current situation of public safety across the nation. The aim of the project is to draw insights that might be useful for drafting of policies regarding public safety or taking measures to prevent homicides as a whole.

## Planned Work 🏗️:

- [ ] Detailed fundamental analysis of each of the datasets. Answer questions like how many datapoints are we considering for drawing a particular inference? Is there any missing values? What is the structure of the data? Can there be any possible bias related to the source or the conditions under which it was collected?
- [ ] Categorical analysis of homicides: stabbing, molestation and sexual offences, gun violence, robbery, etc
- [ ] Demographic, Racial and Gender analysis of homicides
- [ ] Compare and contrast homicides by minors
- [ ] Draw correlation between social/political events and rise/fall in crime rate
- [ ] Final Conclusions
